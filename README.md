A high-fidelity recreation of the classic iTunes Cover Flow interaction, built for the modern web using React, Next.js, Tailwind and Motion.

![Cover Flow Example](public/example.png)

- Driven by motion springs for weighty, responsive, and fully interruptible animations.
- Uses hardware-accelerated CSS 3D transforms for smooth, refresh-rate-independent performance.
- Supports mouse, touch, and keyboard interactions with velocity-aware dragging and arrow-key navigation.
- Drops cleanly into shadcn-based projects via the CLI or manual install, following the same conventions and structure.
- Works seamlessly in modern React and Next.js environments, including App Router setups.
- Adapts gracefully to different container sizes and layouts by default.
- Styled with Tailwind CSS and compatible with next-themes for dark mode support.
- Isolated transform-based animations ensure the surrounding layout never shifts.
